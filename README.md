# Make Thematic plot using Geojson and CSV

### Problem Statement: Using the data files (listing, neighborhood.json), answers these questions 
- a. Top areas with the highest number of listing (you have to map the listing pointers with their neighbourhood polygons) 
- b. Thematic map of the neighbourhood (broken down by single room, entire home). Save the images in the GitHub folder. 
- c. Who are the top 10 hosts by their total number of listings? 
- d. One metric or insight of your choice.  

## A. TOP areas on thematic map

## D. Insight of My work.

- Frist we have mapped the listing to neihbourhood data.
- Then we have worked on the plots of the top areas.
- Then we have woeked with lognitude and lattitude, from there we can understand the thematic map from that.
- Atlast we have analyzed the data and made the top  hosting areas list and also top neighborhoods.(TOP 10)
